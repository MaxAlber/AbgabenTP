    <h1>Writing Style</h1><p></p>
      <h3>
      A very important factor is the clever and unique style of Burgess in using Nadsat, a very special slang.
       the very second sentence of Chapter 1 shows just how clever the text as a whole can be: <p></p>

      There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter bastard though dry. (1.1.2).</h3>

    <h1>Critic on the Society</h1>
      
     <h3> I think the critical view on society, or modern society, is the most important part of the book. Anthony Burgess wants us to think about how modern society is supressing our free will. It also critizises the authorities of our society, and the fact that we are accepting the suppression of our free will. In the definition of the book, the rules of our society are making us to blind slaves, who are no longer able to act free. 
         <p></p>It wants to tell us, that every human being has a bad side, but its suppressed by our conditioning. Now we have to decide for ourselves if its good that we lost our ability to decide by free will.</h3>

      <h1>Review</h1>
      <h3>
    I really much enjoyed reading the book, most because of its critical view on our world and society. Although I liked to read it, its a bit hard to understand because of the slang thats used in the book. Its called "Nadsat" and its completely made up by the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. Its a mixture of anglicized Russian words and Cockney rhyming slang. <p></p>In case you want to read the book, I suggest you to take an easier version of the book and not the original one from Anthony Burgess. Or you could also watch the movie (one of the greatest movies of all time in my eyes).</h3>
